#Data
This data consists of accelerometer and gyroscope data from the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset.
Mean and standard deviation data from several test subjects for each of the three spatial axes, both based on the time domain and with a Fourier transform applied, is averaged and broken down by the activity being performed.

#Variables
The columns have been named in as user-friendly a way as is practical. Since it is the symbol for standard deviation, "s" is used to denote the column of standard deviation data.

#Operations
Data was combined between the training and test data sets, and all non-mean and non-standard-deviation data was removed (activity label excepted), as were duplicate columns. Column names were made more descriptive, and the data was averaged.
