# GettingCleaningDataFinal
This repo contains one script meant to operate with wearable-product data from Samsung as found here: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

To reproduce this data, unzip this folder directly into the working directory.

The data is manipulated into a view containing averages of the mean and standard deviation variables for accelerometer and gyroscope data in the original dataset, broken down by activity.
